## How To Play

Hunt is an easy word search app. You can play with or without a timer, or in blitz mode, where you must find each individual word in a much smaller length of time.

## Translating
Any help with translating Hunt into other languages would be much appreciated :).

Obviously the accuracy of the translation matters most, however please try as much as possible to keep words between 4 -> 8 characters long. 
Also, do not include spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters

It just helps as when the words are too long they are really easy to spot, and can even cause errors if they are larger than the grid. 
**Because of this, words can be AT MOST 16 characters, but ideally none are over 12 characters.**
